# Analysis
## Determine key statistical data about the month of June and December
    There are small differences between Jun and December.
 ## Suggestion:
    Statistical data should be run for all months.
    A significant difference between April and October and January's mean. 
    If we only run analysis for June and December which we assume that there will be differences between them, we miss our chances to look at the other months. 
    Analysis on one year only will not yield the most accurate data.
